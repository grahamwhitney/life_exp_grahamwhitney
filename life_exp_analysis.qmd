# Abstract

Here, I re-examine the analysis of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).

# Life Expectancy Analysis

Here is the code to organize data for analysis

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

gapminder::gapminder_unfiltered

sumdat <- gapminder::gapminder_unfiltered%>%
  group_by(year)%>%
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp, na.rm = TRUE))%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  select(year, country, lifeExp)

```
